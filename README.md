## 🎨 Creative Suite

Pixaroma turns ComfyUI into a powerful, easy-to-use design space. It brings professional editing right into your workflow!

### ✨ Image Composer
Easily combine and arrange multiple images. Move, scale, and rotate layers using a simple visual editor. **Per-layer blur** lets you focus or defocus any layer non-destructively with a simple slider. **Shift+Scroll wheel** scales the selected layer in place for quick adjustments. Use the eraser to tweak things by hand, or let our AI background removal tool isolate objects for you instantly.

### 🧊 3D Builder
A full 3D scene editor right inside ComfyUI. Drop in shapes, trees, houses, furniture, or import your own 3D models. You get easy camera controls, realistic lighting, undo/redo, and live previews. Perfect for making reference scenes for ControlNet or depth maps!

### 🎚️ AudioReact Pixaroma
Audio-reactive image-to-video. **No extra models needed**, just an image and an audio track. Open the fullscreen editor, scrub the audio, and watch 15 motion modes (Pulse Zoom, Camera Shake, Glitch, Pinch, Wave, Tilt, Pixelate, RGB Split, and more) react to the beat in real time with a live WebGL preview. Stack 8 overlay effects on top: chroma shift, bloom, vignette, hue shift, cinematic teal/orange grade, letterbox, scanlines, and film grain. Pairs with **Save Mp4 Pixaroma** to write the clip directly to MP4 with audio muxed in. Requires WebGL2.

### ✂️ Image Crop
No more guessing crop sizes with numbers! Visually draw your crop box, or set width, height, position and a center/edge alignment right on the node - math expressions like `1024+512` work too. Standard presets (1:1, 16:9, 9:16…) keep social and video aspects locked. Wire **any IMAGE** output into the node (Load Image, VAE Decode, anything) and run the workflow once - the editor and mini-preview will show the live source. Or paste an image straight from the clipboard with **Ctrl+V**.

### 🌓 Image Compare
The best way to see the difference between two images. Easily compare them side-by-side with a slider, overlap them, or highlight exactly what changed between the two versions.

![Image Compare Editor](workflows/Image%20Compare%20Pixaroma%20Workflow%20v2.jpg?v=2)

### 🖼️ Load Image Pixaroma
A drop-in replacement for ComfyUI's native LoadImage with everything you'd want in one node. Same upload / drag-drop / Ctrl+V paste / multi-frame / alpha-to-mask behavior as native, plus inline resize: pick from **Off**, **Max megapixels**, **Longest side**, **Scale by ×**, **Fit inside**, **Crop to fill**, or **Match aspect ratio** with a sub-toggle for Crop or Pad (12 ratio presets + Custom, with a Pixaroma color picker for the Pad color). **Snap to /8/16/32/64**, **Resample picker** (Auto / Nearest / Bilinear / Bicubic / Lanczos with one-line hints under each), and an **Allow upscaling** toggle apply on top. Numeric fields accept math expressions (`1024+64`, `512*2`), ↑↓ arrow stepping (Shift = 10×), and have visible +/- spinner buttons. A live **Input → Output** info bar with tiny aspect-ratio rectangles shows you exactly what dimensions the workflow will produce as you tweak settings. Outputs include `IMAGE`, `MASK`, `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `FILENAME` (no extension), `ORIGINAL_WIDTH`, `ORIGINAL_HEIGHT` — eliminates downstream Get Image Size + Image Scale chains in most workflows.

### 📝 Note Pixaroma
A beautiful, simple text editor to document your workflows right on the canvas. Write normally with bold, italics, lists, headings, code blocks (with copy button), and inline icons (CLIP, LORA, GGUF, model versions, and 30+ more). Drop in custom-colored **buttons** (Download / View Page / Read More / plain), **separators** (5 line styles: solid, dashed, dotted, double, thick), **tables**, and **folder hints** for download paths. Each block carries its OWN colour, picked from a clean modal that opens centered on the screen, so two separators (or two grids, or two folder hints) in the same note can have totally different looks. YouTube and Discord pills come pre-colored. There is also a Code view for hand-editing the underlying HTML, plus a drop-in LLM prompt at `assets/note-pixaroma-llm-prompt.txt` if you want ChatGPT, Gemini, or a custom GPT to generate notes for you. It perfectly saves and restores exactly how you styled it.

### 🎬 Save Mp4 Pixaroma
Encode video frames + optional audio straight to MP4. Built-in `<video>` preview right on the node so you can watch the result without leaving ComfyUI. Pairs with AudioReact, but works with any source that produces frames + AUDIO.

### 💬 Show Text Pixaroma
See what text or data is flowing through your nodes, with a real read-only text box you can **select and copy** from. **Resize the node freely** in any direction; long text scrolls with a scrollbar instead of forcing the node to grow. New **STRING output** lets you chain it into other nodes (great for inspecting a prompt before passing it on). Saves and restores with your workflow.

### 🖼️ Preview Image Pixaroma
A handy way to preview your images right on the node, but better! Works with **single images and full batches**: every frame appears as a thumbnail strip with a `i / N` counter - click any thumbnail to open it large inside the node. Use the **arrow keys** (← →) to flip through the batch, click anywhere on the open image to advance to the next, hit `Esc` or the `×` button to collapse back. Two save buttons act on the currently selected frame: **Save to Disk** (choose any folder on your computer; the suggested filename auto-increments per click) and **Save to Output** (saves to ComfyUI's `output/`, supports subfolder syntax like `SDXL/portrait`). Flip the **save_mode** widget to `save` and the node turns into a drop-in replacement for SaveImage - every batch frame is automatically written to `output/` with embedded workflow metadata. Both modes embed your workflow into the saved PNG so you can drag it back into ComfyUI later. The preview also **survives workflow tab switching**, so you can leave it on a frame and come back to it later.

### 📐 Resolution Pixaroma
A simple, one-click resolution picker. Choose from 9 popular aspect ratios - 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, and 4:5 (Instagram-portrait friendly) - and instantly get the exact width and height you need, including popular sizes for AI video. Type any Custom Ratio (21:9, 16:10, anything) with auto-computed AI-friendly sizes, or use Custom Resolution to type exact dimensions. Math expressions work in the Width and Height fields too - type `1024+128` or `512*2` and it just works. It perfectly saves all your settings with your workflow!

### 🔔 Notify Pixaroma
A small terminal node that plays a sound when reached during workflow execution. Drop one at the end of a workflow to hear "render finished" while you're in another browser tab or app, or branch one off any node mid-graph to be alerted at a checkpoint. Pick from 10 bundled notification sounds (drop more `.mp3`/`.wav`/`.ogg` into `assets/sounds/` to extend), set a per-node volume and an optional label, and tap the **▶ Preview** button to audition a sound without running the workflow. A master toggle in **Settings → 👑 Pixaroma → Notify** silences every Notify node at once for quiet sessions. Each node also has its own enabled toggle. Always re-fires on every Run, even when upstream is fully cached.

### 🧲 Align Pixaroma
A canvas-wide smart-snap and alignment-guide system. Toggle it on with the mountain icon in the top toolbar (next to the Manager). Once enabled, dragging or resizing any node makes its edges and centers snap to nearby nodes, with thin orange guide lines showing exactly what aligned with what (Photoshop / Figma style). Multi-selection drags as a rigid bounding box. A column of 3+ nodes sharing an edge gets a single guide spanning the whole column. Hold **Shift** to bypass snap for a single drag (Alt is reserved by ComfyUI for duplicate-during-drag). Snap distance is adjustable (4 to 16 screen pixels) under **Settings → 👑 Pixaroma → Align (advanced)**. Default OFF, zero overhead until you toggle it on.

## 🛠 Changelog

### **May 12, 2026 (1.3.21)**
- **NEW: Load Image Pixaroma** — a drop-in replacement for ComfyUI's `LoadImage` with inline resize controls and 7 outputs. Same file-picker / drag-drop / Ctrl+V paste / multi-frame / alpha-to-mask behavior as native, plus 7 resize modes (Off, Max megapixels, Longest side, Scale by ×, Fit inside, Crop to fill, Match aspect ratio with Crop or Pad) all driven from chips and numeric inputs on the node — no need to open an editor. Match-aspect-ratio offers 11 presets + Custom (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, 4:5, 21:9, 5:4) and a Pixaroma color picker for the Pad color. Snap-to-multiple (8 / 16 / 32 / 64), Resample picker with hint text under each option (Auto / Nearest / Bilinear / Bicubic / Lanczos), and an Allow-upscaling toggle apply as post-modifiers. Numeric fields accept math expressions like `1024+64` or `512*2`, ↑↓ arrow stepping (Shift+arrow = 10× step), and have visible +/- spinner buttons. A live INPUT → OUTPUT info bar with tiny aspect-ratio rectangles shows the source dims + resulting dims as you tweak settings, so you can see exactly what the workflow will produce before you Run. Outputs: `IMAGE`, `MASK`, `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `FILENAME` (without extension), `ORIGINAL_WIDTH`, `ORIGINAL_HEIGHT` — eliminates downstream Get Image Size + Image Scale + Image Resize chains in most workflows.

### **May 10, 2026 (1.3.20)**
- **Parameters tab no longer breaks Pixaroma nodes:** Switching to the right-sidebar **Parameters** tab on any Pixaroma editor / preview node (Paint, Image Composer, Image Crop, 3D Builder, Resolution, Note, Show Text, Save Mp4, Preview Image, Reference) used to duplicate the node's canvas-painted UI inside the Parameters panel AND visually spread / break the node body itself. Fixed by adding the `canvasOnly` flag to every internal widget so the Parameters tab skips them.
- **Preview Image Pixaroma - native grid layout for batches:** Reworked the Grid mode to use native ComfyUI's exact `calculateImageGrid` algorithm (iterate column count 1..N, pick the one that maximises total image area). Cells are now sized to the scaled images, so cells touch directly with NO per-cell letterbox; the whole grid is centered inside the available space, and any unused area sits at the edges instead of between thumbnails. Layout adapts cleanly to node aspect: wide node + 5 imgs → 5×1, square + 5 imgs → 2×3, tall narrow + 5 imgs → 1×5. Pixel-equivalent to native PreviewImage at the same node size.
- **Preview Image Pixaroma - badge / Description polish:** The orange `i / N` selection badge no longer overlaps the orange selection border at any aspect ratio (anchored to image bottom-right, always dark, drawn after border). The node's right-sidebar Info panel Description rewritten as concise plain prose (the panel renders plain text, not markdown - empirical fix for the "wall of text" complaint).

### **May 10, 2026 (1.3.19)**
- **Preview Image Pixaroma - grid layout for batches:** Multi-image batches now wrap into a 2D grid by default (3 imgs → 2×2, 5 imgs → 2×3, 9 imgs → 3×3...), matching native PreviewImage. Thumbnails stay big regardless of batch size, no more wasted vertical space. A small toggle icon in the top-right of the preview flips between **Grid** and **Strip** (single horizontal row, the previous behavior) per node; the default for new nodes lives under **Settings → 👑 Pixaroma → Preview → Default batch layout**.
- **Preview Image Pixaroma - date tokens in `filename_prefix`:** The filename field now accepts the same date-folder syntax as VHS / Save Image extras: `%date:yyyy-MM-dd%/img` writes into `output/2026-05-10/img_00001_.png`. Native ComfyUI tokens (`%year%`, `%month%`, `%day%`, `%hour%`, `%minute%`, `%second%`, `%width%`, `%height%`) also work. Hover the field for examples. Applies to both the **Save to Output** button and `save_mode=save`.
- **Preview Image Pixaroma - badge polish:** The `i / N` counter pill no longer overlaps with the orange selection border at certain image aspect ratios, and stays a consistent dark pill in every state instead of going orange-on-orange when selected.

### **May 10, 2026 (1.3.18)**
- **Image Composer fix:** the canvas background colour you pick in the editor now survives the workflow run. Previously, if a Composer had placeholder slots (or auto-rembg or eraser masks), running the workflow flipped the background from your chosen colour to black in BOTH the in-node mini preview and the downstream Preview Image. Re-save any existing project to carry the colour forward; older saves without a saved bg colour fall back to the editor's default dark grey.
- **Editor mini-preview squaring fix:** the small preview thumbnail under Image Composer / Paint / Image Crop / 3D Builder nodes now stays square as you resize the node, instead of locking into a wide letterboxed rectangle that only "snapped right" once you ran the workflow. Caused by ComfyUI's new Vue frontend not reliably firing `node.onResize` for DOM-widget resizes; switched to a `ResizeObserver` so size changes always update.
- **Help panel polish (every node):** ComfyUI's right-side Info tab now shows real Description text for every Pixaroma node instead of blank rows. Each input also has a hover tooltip explaining what to wire and what it does.
- **Banner notice rewrite:** the "Some Pixaroma nodes conflict with Nodes 2.0" line at startup was a bright orange one-liner that several users read as an error. It's now two grey lines starting with "This is a notice, not an error" and only the **Pixaroma** brand word stays orange. Same intent, less alarm.

### **May 09, 2026**
- **NEW: Notify Pixaroma** - a tiny terminal node that plays a sound when reached during a workflow run. Drop one at the end of a workflow to hear "render finished" when you're in another browser tab or app, or branch one off any checkpoint. 10 bundled sounds in `assets/sounds/` (drop in your own `.mp3`/`.wav`/`.ogg` to extend). Per-node enabled toggle, volume slider, label, and a **▶ Preview** button to audition a sound without running the workflow. Master toggle under **Settings → 👑 Pixaroma → Notify** silences every Notify node at once. Always re-fires on every Run, even when upstream is fully cached. Help panel now shows full Description + per-input tooltips.

### **May 08, 2026**
- **Align Pixaroma fixes:** Ctrl+drag marquee selection no longer slides previously-selected nodes around (regression that surfaced once 2+ nodes were already selected). Random "the selection shifts a tiny bit" when starting a new marquee right after a previous one is also gone — that was a pre-threshold dead-zone leak in the snap math. Canvas pans also no longer trigger snap.

### **May 07, 2026**
- **Preview Image Pixaroma fixes:** Single-image previews now always show the `WxH` dimension footer (previously only batches did). Going from a batch (in expanded view) to a single-image run no longer leaves a stuck close X over the new image.
- **Show Text Pixaroma rewrite:** Real read-only text box you can **select and copy text from** (the old canvas-painted version did not allow selection). **Resize the node freely** in any direction; long text scrolls instead of forcing the node to grow. New **STRING output** named `text` so the node can chain into other nodes - inspect a prompt and still pass it on. Last-shown text saves and restores with the workflow.
- **Note Pixaroma - centered-modal overhaul:** Every insert button (Icon, Separator, Grid, Button, Folder hint, YouTube, Discord) now opens a clean centered modal with its own colour picker. Each inserted block carries its **own** colour, so two separators (or two grids, or two folder hints) in the same note can look completely different.
- **5 separator styles + grid colour pickers + plain button option:** Separators come in solid, dashed, dotted, double, or thick. Grids have per-instance border AND header background colours. Buttons can be Download, View Page, Read More, or a plain pill with no icon.
- **New Folder hint toolbar button:** Folder bundling moved out of the button modal into its own entry. Use it to add a "Place in: ComfyUI/..." line under any button.
- **LLM prompt file:** `assets/note-pixaroma-llm-prompt.txt` is a drop-in system prompt for ChatGPT or Gemini so they can generate Code-view-ready HTML for your notes.

### **May 06, 2026**
- **NEW: Align Pixaroma:** Toggleable smart-snap and alignment-guide system for the node canvas. Click the mountain icon in the top toolbar to enable; dragging or resizing nodes then snaps to nearby edges and centers with thin orange guide lines. Hold **Shift** to bypass snap for one drag. Default OFF (zero overhead when disabled).
- **Note Pixaroma colour pickers:** Text and highlight pickers got an Excel-style swatches popup (3 rows of 12 = 36 colours, Reset, "More colours..." for HSV/hex). Picks are now sticky across cursor moves and typing sessions.
- **Image Crop upgrade:** Now works with **any IMAGE source**, not just Load Image (wire a VAE Decode or anything producing an IMAGE). Compact W / H / X / Y / Ratio / Alignment panel right on the node body. Math expressions in the number fields. Press **Ctrl+V** to paste an image straight from your clipboard.

### **May 05, 2026**
- **Image Composer - per-layer blur:** Non-destructive Gaussian blur slider in the Transform Properties panel. Each layer keeps its own blur value.
- **Image Composer - Shift+Scroll** scales the selected layer (±5% per tick).
- **Image Composer fixes:** High-res upstream images no longer get downsampled to the placeholder slot size; placeholder ratio changes preserve the image preview; selection box no longer drifts at canvas edges.

### **May 04, 2026**
- **Preview Image Pixaroma upgrade:** Batches render as a horizontal thumbnail strip with `i / N` counters - click any thumbnail to open it inline at full size; arrow keys navigate; Esc collapses. New **save_mode** widget: flip to `save` and the node becomes a drop-in for SaveImage with workflow metadata embedded. Previews survive workflow tab switching.
- **Resolution Pixaroma:** Added 4:3, 3:4, and 4:5 aspect ratios. New **Custom Ratio** mode for any W:H. Math expressions now work in the Width and Height fields.

### **April 27, 2026**
- **NEW: AudioReact Pixaroma**: turn an image into an audio-reactive video with a fullscreen WebGL editor. 15 motion modes, 8 stackable overlays, real-time scrubbable preview.
- **NEW: Save Mp4 Pixaroma**: encode frames + audio straight to MP4, with an in-node video preview.

### **April 25, 2026**

- **Offline 3D Builder:** The 3D Builder no longer needs an internet connection to start.
- **Paint Fixes:** Fixed the brush cursor disappearing, and added a new "Remove Background" AI button.
- **Composer Fixes:** Layer blend modes (like Multiply or Screen) now save and load correctly.
- **3D Shortcuts:** Added Blender-style keyboard shortcuts (G to move, Shift+D to duplicate, etc.).

### **April 15, 2026**
